  "text": "Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: \u2018The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.\u2019",

Salary man may refer to the choice of clothing in the shoot which sees each dad in a sharply dressed suit. The images see the fathers pull energetic poses despite their age with some of the expressions of the older fathers looking slightly pained. Very little else is known about the pictures or why they have come into existence but they are already drumming up plenty of interest online for their curious nature. The 37-year-old's images are said to be part of a book which roughly translates as Daughter and Salaryman Each image sees the daughter stood po-faced as their father makes an energetic leap Some of the older fathers adopt a pained expression as they make their jump Each photograph sees the daughter wearing casual clothing with her father in a sharp suit The pictures see the families pose in front of various Japanese landmarks Very little is known about the set of photos but they are already drumming up plenty of interest online Some of the jumps are more subtle than others with this father opting for a classic jump This young girl can't help but giggle at her dad's ambitious leap This dapper dad adds a peace gesture into his final pose This father can't help but jump for joy in his portrait",

I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league.
