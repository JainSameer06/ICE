The former Manchester City striker's deal with the Serie A champions does not expire until the end of next season but he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer. Boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club\u00a0president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with the Italians first. Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory 'We must be careful', Angelici told TYC Sports. 'We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016. 'We are close to sealing his return and it will be done shortly.' The Argentina international joined Boca's youth academy in 1996 and went on to score 26 league goals in 76 appearances for the club before joining Corinthians in 2005. Although Juventus are reluctant to lose the league's top scorer - Tevez has netted 17 times this season - they have accepted the player wants to leave and have already started identifying potential replacements.

'The most important thing for me is that Tevez continues to play as well as he is at the moment,' Martino told Italian paper Tuttosport. 'It doesn't matter whether that's at Juventus or Boca. Only he'll know what's best for his future. 'I will say this, though: Juventus are a great team, but so are Boca Juniors. It wouldn't be a step down.'",

When one of Mr Kyle's famous lie detector tests revealed that Jamie, who lives with Dawn and her partner who is also called Jamie, had done the deed, she burst into tears and stormed off. Scroll down for video Devastated: Dawn, who has had seven miscarriages, was furious to discover her friend had stolen from her The drama began when Dawn, who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show, discovered that \u00a3207 set aside for a \u00a3500 grave stone had disappeared. Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol, she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial. 'Only him and Carol knew where it was,' she said during an angry confrontation on the ITV show. 'Me and Jamie had been saving up and only Carol knew where it was.' Unable to prove it, she asked Mr Kyle to conduct a lie detector test and when the results came back, it showed that Jamie had indeed taken the cash. Caught out: Jamie, who has been to prison for burglary, was found to be lying after taking a test Outraged: Dawn, who was going to spend the money on a gravestone, was left furious by the revelation Mr Kyle also revealed that Jamie had sent a Facebook message to Dawn during the journey to London in which he declared his undying love and confessed to taking the money but blamed it on girlfriend Carol. Speaking after the show, a sobbing Dawn said: \u00a0'I've had seven miscarriages and only one of them I've had to bury. 'That was Daniel James and the \u00a3207 was put aside because the head stone was going to cost \u00a3500 altogether. 'We had to stand there and say goodbye to Daniel James and the last thing I wanted to do for Daniel James was put a head stone on him so he knew how much his mummy and daddy loved him. I feel betrayed, horrible. You try and do a good gesture to people and then you get it thrown in your face.' Tears: She then burst into tears and rushed off the stage - pursued by the Jeremy Kyle cameras Sobbing: She was comforted by her partner, also called Jamie, after the show",

  "text": "First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with\u00a0a delightful free-kick Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.",
