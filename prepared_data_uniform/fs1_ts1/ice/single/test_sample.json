In each picture the daughter looks directly into the camera smiling while her father pulls a dramatic pose. A series of images by photographer\u00a0Y\u00fbki Aoyama sees fathers leaping into the air next to their daughters The images are from the 37-year-old's latest book which roughly translates into Daughter and Salary Man. According to the \u00a0photographer's website\u00a0the images allow the father who usually has to act serious to express his fun side by being 'a hero jumping the sky, enfold(ing) strong excitement and hope.' Salary man may refer to the choice of clothing in the shoot which sees each dad in a sharply dressed suit. The images see the fathers pull energetic poses despite their age with some of the expressions of the older fathers looking slightly pained. Very little else is known about the pictures or why they have come into existence but they are already drumming up plenty of interest online for their curious nature. The 37-year-old's images are said to be part of a book which roughly translates as Daughter and Salaryman Each image sees the daughter stood po-faced as their father makes an energetic leap Some of the older fathers adopt a pained expression as they make their jump Each photograph sees the daughter wearing casual clothing with her father in a sharp suit The pictures see the families pose in front of various Japanese landmarks Very little is known about the set of photos but they are already drumming up plenty of interest online Some of the jumps are more subtle than others with this father opting for a classic jump This young girl can't help but giggle at her dad's ambitious leap This dapper dad adds a peace gesture into his final pose This father can't help but jump for joy in his portrait",
